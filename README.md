# lpass-env

This is an (unofficial) script which wraps the LastPass CLI [lpass](https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli) to manage environment variables like API keys, passwords, &c. Of course, you can use it for non-secret configuration variables too.

This script is intended as a replacement to putting variables in `~/.bash_profile`, and it's better because:

* Variables are not stored in a plaintext file, only in the LastPass vault.
* Variables are not injected into every shell environment, so malicious scripts can't read your secrets unless you are running them inside an `lpass-env shell`.
* Variables can easily be synced with your other machines.
* Variables can be shared with others using LastPass instead of copy/paste.
* Variables can be managed in the LastPass vault from any PC.

On the other hand, using LastPass introduces quite a bit of overhead compared to `~/.bash_profile`. If you aren't familiar with the [lpass](https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli) tool, check that out first -- there's a bit of a learning curve.

**Q:** Why use LastPass instead of \<X>?

**A:** Check out the "Why LastPass?" section of my [announcement blog post](http://blog.luketurner.org/announcing-lpass-add-and-lpass-env-ergonomically-get-secrets-out-of-lastpass).


## Installation

It's just a Bash script. You can install it however you want, but something like this seems pretty popular:

``` bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/luketurner/lpass-env/master/bin/lpass-env -o /usr/local/bin/lpass-env && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lpass-env
```

However, `lpass-env` depends on the LastPass CLI tool `lpass`, which must also be installed on your machine. See the [lpass docs](https://github.com/lastpass/lastpass-cli) for more information about that. (Spoiler for OS X users: `brew update && brew install lastpass-cli --with-pinentry`) 

## Usage

`lpass-env` is an extremely short script that calls into `lpass` to do the dirty work of actually managing credentials. However, it does have a few different parameters and modes of operation, which are intended to support different common ways of using environment variables. You can run `lpass-env help` for help and usage examples, or just look at them here:

```
Usage: lpass-env [action] [lpass-key-id]

Valid actions: help, shell, print, export

Examples

  Launch a subshell with env vars:
    $ lpass-env shell my/key/name

  Write the vars to a file:
    $ lpass-env print my/key/name > ~/my_vars.sh

  Export the vars into running shell:
    $ $(lpass-env export my/key/name)
```

### Usage with spaces

If your environment variables have quoted spaces (e.g. `FOO="bar baz"`), the `$(lpass-env export foo)` syntax won't correctly interpret the quotes (see [related issue](https://github.com/luketurner/lpass-env/issues/4)). You can consider `eval "$(lpass-env export foo)"` as an alternative that handles them correctly.

As with anything involving `eval`, it's not really recommended. But if you need it, the option is there at your own risk.

### Managing credentials with lpass

The `lpass-env` script does not provide a way to add or edit credentials, because the existing `lpass edit` command is already good for that. Instead, `lpass-env` gives a read-only interface and assumes that it will only be used with existing LastPass credentials where the `notes` field contains environment variable declarations (like `MYKEYNAME=value`). Said declarations should not include `export`, `readonly`, or (obviously) `local`, but they actually can include other variable expansions or command substitutions (i.e. `${ ... }` and `$( ... )`)

Consider this example, which creates a new credential and then exports it into the current shell session:

``` bash
# Create a credential with two environment keys in the notes field
$ cat | lpass edit --notes my-dev-environment << EOF
MY_API_KEY=asdf
MY_API_SECRET=fdsa
MY_API_CLIENT_ID=$(hostname)
EOF

# Exports the credentials into our environment
# Note that 'lpass-env export' returns executable code, which is why
# it's wrapped in $( ... )
$ $(lpass-env export my-dev-environment)

# Now, 'env' includes MY_API_KEY, MY_API_SECRET, and MY_API_CLIENT_ID
$ env | grep MY_API
```

(An alternative way to get the variables into scope is to use the `lpass-env shell` to create a subshell: `lpass-env shell my-dev-environment` instead of `$(lpass-env export my-dev-environment)`)

### Organizing credentials

I have a practice of putting all my `lpass-env` credentials inside an `ENV` folder in my LastPass vault. Within that folder, I create LastPass credentials for all my API keys, access tokens, or whatever. (I have nested subfolders, too.)

It is possible to have more than one environment variable declared per credential, and I use that feature to declare codependent variables side-by-side (for example, if you have an access key plus a secret key, or a set of configuration variables for an app). However, if the variables are not codependent, I declare them in separate credentials so that I can limit which applications can see which credentials, and also to make sharing them easier.

I recommend you find a system that works well for you and integrates into the rest of your LastPass workflow. `lpass-env` only uses Notes fields and it makes no assumptions about how your LastPass credentials are managed, so it should be easily integrated into your personal system.
